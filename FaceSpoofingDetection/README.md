Face Spoofing Detection Model

This project implements a Face Spoofing Detection model aimed at differentiating between real and spoofed facial inputs (e.g., printed photos, video replays, and 3D mask attacks) to enhance security in facial recognition systems.

Project Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to build a model that can classify whether a given facial input is real or spoofed. The model is trained using images of real faces and spoofed faces (printed photos, video replays, and 3D masks). The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and is trained with TensorFlow/Keras.

Installation

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 - 3.10 (for compatibility with TensorFlow)
Virtual Environment (recommended)
Steps to Install
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd FaceSpoofingDetection
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Pillow (if not already installed):
pip install Pillow
Install SciPy (if not already installed):
pip install scipy
Required Datasets
You can use the CASIA-FASD or Replay-Attack dataset for training:
Once downloaded, add the images in the dataset/ folder:

dataset/train/real/ for real face images
dataset/train/spoof/ for spoofed face images
dataset/validation/real/ for validation real face images
dataset/validation/spoof/ for validation spoofed face images
Dataset Structure

The dataset should follow this structure:

FaceSpoofingDetection/
│
├── dataset/
│   ├── train/
│   │   ├── real/       <-- Real face images
│   │   ├── spoof/      <-- Spoofed face images (printed photos, video replays, 3D masks)
│   │
│   ├── validation/
│   │   ├── real/       <-- Real face images for validation
│   │   ├── spoof/      <-- Spoofed face images for validation

Training the Model

Run the training script:
python3 train.py
This will:

Train the model using the dataset in dataset/train/ and dataset/validation/.
Save the trained model as model/face_spoofing_model.h5.
Training logs will show the model's accuracy and loss during each epoch.
Testing the Model

To test the trained model on an image, use the following script:

Run the testing script:
python3 test.py
Provide the path to the test image in the test.py file.
Output: The model will output whether the face is real or spoofed, along with the confidence score.
Model Saving and Loading

After training, the model will be saved as model/face_spoofing_model.h5. You can also use the newer Keras model format (.keras):

model.save('model/face_spoofing_model.keras')
To load the model for prediction:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('model/face_spoofing_model.h5')  # Or .keras format
