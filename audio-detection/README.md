# Audio Detection and Monitoring System

## Overview

This Python-based application enables real-time audio monitoring and detection of specific keywords in audio streams. It utilizes speech recognition and audio processing technologies to identify and log suspicious events.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Monitoring**: Continuously captures and analyzes audio input.
- **Keyword Detection**: Detects specified keywords in audio, with a default set of keywords such as "help," "answer," and "cheat."
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses Google Speech Recognition API for analyzing and converting audio to text.
- **Event Logging**: Logs suspicious events with detailed information.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust audio sensitivity with a customizable threshold.
- **Monitoring Reports**: Generates reports summarizing suspicious events within a monitoring session.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Dependencies**:
   - `pyaudio`
   - `speech_recognition`
   - `numpy`
   - `pydub`

   Install all dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **FFmpeg Installation**:
   - Ensure FFmpeg and FFprobe are installed and added to the system's PATH.
   - Update file paths in the script to point to your FFmpeg installation.

3. **Hardware**:
   - A working microphone for audio input.

---

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python audio-detection.py
   ```
3. Monitor the console for detected keywords and logged events.

---

## Configuration

- Modify the following parameters in the `AudioMonitor` class to customize behavior:
  - `threshold`: Set the audio sensitivity (default: 0.05).
  - `keywords`: Define a list of keywords to detect.

---

## Example Output

When a keyword is detected in the audio:
```plaintext
ALERT: Keyword detected: help in phrase 'please help me'
```

---

## Logging and Reports

- Logs are saved to `audio_monitor.log`.
- Monitoring reports include total events, event descriptions, and timestamps.

---

## Testing

Run the `test_audio_monitor` function to simulate monitoring for 60 seconds:
```python
python audio-detection.py
```

---

## Limitations

- Internet connection is required for Google Speech Recognition API.
- Keywords are case-insensitive but limited to predefined phrases.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for alternative speech recognition APIs.
- Extend functionality to detect patterns beyond keywords.
